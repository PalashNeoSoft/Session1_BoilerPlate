Understand Program.cs:
In the Program.cs file, the web project's entry point is defined. 
It typically contains code to set up the web host and configure the application's
services and middleware. It initializes the web server and starts listening for 
incoming HTTP requests.

Understand appsettings.json:
The appsettings.json file is used to store configuration settings for the application. 
It allows you to define various values such as database connection strings, API keys, 
logging settings, etc. You can access these settings throughout your application by 
reading the values from the Configuration object.

Understand Environments:
Environments in ASP.NET Core provide a way to define different configurations for 
different deployment environments like development, staging, and production. By 
using environment-specific configuration files(e.g., appsettings.Development.json, 
appsettings.Staging.json), you can override the settings defined in the general 
appsettings.json file based on the environment.

Understand Middleware:
Middleware components in ASP.NET Core are responsible for processing HTTP requests and 
generating HTTP responses. They form a pipeline through which each request flows, and each
middleware component can perform tasks such as authentication, routing, logging, 
error handling, etc. Understanding middleware is essential to configure the 
request/response pipeline correctly.
